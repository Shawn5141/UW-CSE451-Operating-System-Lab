# UW-CSE451-Operating-System-Lab
This is a lab for UW cse 451 Operating System.

All of labs are based on the Experimental Kernel (i.e., xk). xk is a new experimental
operating system kernel for teaching the principles and practice of operating systems.
xk's baseline code is a complete, bootable operating system. It provides some simple system
calls that it is capable of running a “hello world” program. Your task in each lab is to make
xk complete and also add a few functionalities

All code are programmed in C

- Lab 1: Interrupts and System Calls
- Lab 2: Multiprocessing
- Lab 3: Address Space Management
- Lab 4: Filesystem
