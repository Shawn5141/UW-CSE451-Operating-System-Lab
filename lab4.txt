Question #1
Explain how dirlookup works.

dirlookup searches a directory for an entry with the given name. If it finds an entry then it returns a pointer to the corresponding inode, unlocked, and sets a uint pointer *poff to the byte offset of the entry within the directory.
If it finds a dirent entry with the matching name, it updates *poff, releases the block, and returns an unlocked inode obtained via iget

Question #8
File delete is not a required feature in lab4. Describe how you can implement it in a crash-safe manner even if the file spans multiple blocks.


Question #9
For each member of the project team, how many hours did you spend on this lab?
